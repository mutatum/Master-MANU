/* 
   If function parameters are to be arbitrary, we need an instance of an object
 that has generic (virtual I guess) fluxes and numerical_fluxes, capable of
 calling numerical_fluxes with it's corresponding parameters.
 To rephrase, if received params of num_flux can change, then calling must account for it.
 It seems to me that rather than variadic parameters or bundled together params into an object,
 it is more readable and better suited overall (readability, correspondence to the equation formulation ..)
 to have a class that represents both problem and perhaps the numerical flux. 

 ##Later: Gemini 2.5 Pro suggested something akin to this)

    Completion: exercices 0-5 done on 0% internet (new appartment and no cellular data left), two C++ books (no complete reference book :( )
    Although 5 is partial since I couldn't resist thinking about ex6.
    I just now prompted Gemini that gave me a very good code structure proposal. I'll start implementing it,
    keeping as a rule 0 copy pasting. I'm conflicted as I very heavily dislike having code that doesn't
    originate from my mind, but I'm afraid I can't erase from my memory how seducing the proposed layout seemed.
    I'll post this version with it's mistakes and inefficiencies along side the cleaner one.
